            description: "Developed a mobile app that allows people to create trip itinenaries, view them on maps, and share them with people. Users can create trip itineraries using Chat GPT, share them with their friends, and download itineraries from other users. Users can also view NYC real-time subway arrivals thanks to the GTFS-rt data given by MTA's API. Users can use direction-by-direction navigation as an alternative to Google maps using Open Street Maps API and Open Route Service API. The application also has two databases: one stored locally using SQLite, and another stored online using Firebase. By doing this, users can log-in using Google Sign In services, and share trip itineraries with others. Warning: The GitHub repo is not updated because I use a private repo currently. The code and organization is not representative of the current state of the app. I recently made large-scale UI changes, many bug fixes, and implemented a caching system, which is not reflected anywhere yet.",

For the backend, I used Flask and Postgres, and served content with an API. The jokes in the clean jokes filter are cleaned using linguistic techniques that calculate the Levenshtein distance between unwanted and target words and a ML model trained on toxic wikipedia comments.",
